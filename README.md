My name is David, and this is where I keep all my knowledge as a programmer and developer

<h2> ABOUT ME:</h2>
<p>
Full-Stack Developer with over 8 years of experience creating solutions for games, servers, websites, web applications, and APIs. My career began in game development and scripting, starting with Unturned using Lua, which became a core language in my stack. Since then, I have expanded my expertise across multiple gaming platforms and projects.

I have worked on titles such as FiveM (GTA V) developing systems and mods capable of supporting thousands of simultaneous users. I also founded and managed my own company, leading technological structuring and product development, while providing services for other companies and projects.
